# edward_stan_intro
This repo has a simple introduction to Edward [edwardlib.org] and PyStan [mc-stan.org], options for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Python.

The PDF is a quick walkthrough of some highlight features and a highly-subjective comparison based on one week of familiarity with both options.

The Jupyter notebook and slides give a more detailed walkthrough of the code.
